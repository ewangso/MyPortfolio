        "Ontologies are widely used tools in medical research. An ontology can be described as a wide array of "
        +"data of the same domain that is organized as classes and relations. Usually, ontologies are represented "
        +"in 2-D models. "
        +"The Medical Ontology research project focuses on creating a 3-D model of a medical "
        +"ontology in virtual reality. I worked on this project under Dr. Margartia Vinnikov at the MIXR Lab at the "
        +"New Jersey Institute of Technology. The main goal for this project now is to present it at the Fall 2020 "
        +"Undergraduate Research and Innovation (URI) Seed Program. "
